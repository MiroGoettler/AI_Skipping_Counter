# AI Skipping Counter

## Motivation
In this small project I present a **Python Dashboard for automatic counting of rope skips**. I got the idea for this project because I jump rope for my cardio two to three times a week. As with most training I was trying to improve my performance and started counting the amount of skips and the time of the session. In contrast to counting other exercises like pushups, you have to count a lot faster and to a lot higher numbers. This can be quit annoying and take the fun out of the rope skipping workout.

## Solution
My solution to this problem is a [Plotly Dashboard](https://plotly.com/dash/) with an AI-based Counting System. In this dashboard the user can easily monitore the rope-skipping-session and see metrics like the total amount of skips, the speed of skipping and the time spend. With this the user can concentrate on the physical effort and try to improve the performance.
